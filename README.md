## Problem Definition

Users develop individual technique of typing, from which unique patters can be generated and profiled. This individual biometric characteristic is called keystroke dynamics. By analysing users’ keystroke patterns, these can be used to authenticate users, if attackers are able to find a valid username and password combination.

## A Study: Rhythmic KeyLogger For Authentication

There is a claim in the biometric community that a password coupled with normal rhythmic typing of the owner is stronger than the password on its own. This paper will study this claim based on two hypotheses that analyse the rhythms and profiles of keystrokes using sample data:

I developed a keylogger that would generate keystroke dynamics for a sample of words and then tested the following hypotheses:

H1: A simple rhythm can be determined more easily than a more patterned or dictionary based one.

H2: There is a length L over which the timings of the password and ID are irrelevant. That is, L is more predicative of detection than rhythm when L ≥ N characters.
